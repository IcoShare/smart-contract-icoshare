# ICO Share Smart Contract

Some ICOs may require minimum amount to participate or some other ICOs may offer bundles with related token distribution factor.

Participating to an ICO which requires a minimum amount (e.g. > 10 NEO) can be hard to accomplish for a single person. 
For people who want to participate that ICO, we present a way to create a crowdsourcing mechanism to accumulate required minimum amount by creating an "ICO Share". Anyone can join to the created "ICO Share" and once the required amount collected, it will be sent to NEP5 smart contract and after the token distribution, tokens will be sent to the participators by their factor.

Same feature can be used to participate ICO bundles to get more tokens by sending more NEOs.
For example, in a sample NEP5 ICO, for sending 10 NEO we could get 10.000 NEP5 token, but who ever sends 20 NEO could get 25.000 token (more that 2x tokens for 2x NEOs) 
To collect that bundle amount (25 NEO) people can get together by creating an "ICO Share" through this smart contract.
